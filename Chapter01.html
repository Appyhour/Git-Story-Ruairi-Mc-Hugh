<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong> <br>
    A dull and cold winter's evening it was in this sparsely populated village on the west cost of Ireland.
    Father O'Brien was doing his weekly rounds to his elderly congregants who are either too frail or too isolated to receive communion
    when he heard a manic and high pitch scream through the howling wind. "It's simply some kids joking around" he mumbled to himself
    in an attempt to calm his nerves. Fr. O'Brien was a tall heavy set man but not without athletic attributes, as a man of faith and
    discipline he exercised daily and in his younger years known as a prolific boxer winning underage medals and acclaim locally,
    all of this along with his stern resolve meant that he was not a man to be trifled with or a man who easily scared, yet
    he could feel the blood in his veins turning cold as the terrible screams grew louder as he followed the source.
    "Where is ths damn noise coming from" he exclaimed louder than he meant to as he ran down the grassy trail to the small rocky
    beach just outside the village. there were no lights near the beach and the night was dark and cloudy, he could feel the harsh
    biting wind and the salty spray from the sea on his face. "Who's there?" he yelled trying to sound authoritative but
    a quiver is his voice betrayed how frightened he really was. Between the haze of the sea spray and thee rain he could clearly see
    three figures struggling half submerged "Stop!" he yelled "Stop it!" as the screams started to be interrupted by gurgles
    and splashes. Fr. O'Brien was on the attackers in an instant with a swift blow to the nearest man the second man turned readying
    himself to throw a vicious right hook but it was no good for all of Fr. O'Brien's boxing instincts returned to him and he ducked the
    attack fluidly and retorted with a right hook of his own. The two assailants and victim shocked by this powerful interruption stumbled
    back staring at the tall priest. All of the sudden Fr O'Brien felt a thud on the back of his head. the last thing he heard was a
    splash then, quiet.</p>

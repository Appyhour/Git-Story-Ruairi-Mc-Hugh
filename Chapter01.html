<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong> <br>
    A dull and cold winter's evening it was in this sparsely populated coastal village on the west cost of Ireland.
    Father O'Brien was doing his weekly rounds to his elderly congregants who are either too frail or too isolated to receive communion
    when he heard a manic and high pitch scream through the howling wind. "It's simply some kids joking around" he mumbled to himself
    in an attempt to calm himself. Fr. O'Brien was a tall heavy set man but not without athletic attributes, as a man of faith and
    discipline he exercised daily and in his younger years known as a prolific boxer winning underage medals and acclaim locally,
    all of this along with his stern resolve meant that he was not a man to be trifled with or a man who easily scared, yet
    he could feel the blood in his veins turning cold as the terrible screams grew louder as he followed the source.
    "Where is ths damn noise coming from" he exclaimed louder than he meant to as he ran down the grassy trail to the small rocky
    beach just outside the village. there were no lights near the beach and the night was dark and cloudy, he could feel the harsh
    biting wind and the salty spray from the sea on his face. "Who's there?" he yelled trying to sound authoritative but
    a quiver is his voice betrayed how frightened he really was. /p>
